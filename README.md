# B0XX-vJoy
Emulate the B0XX on Keyboard with vJoy and AutoHotkey

---

Hey! the past few days I've been programing a virtual B0XX in vJoy/AutoHotkey based on the manual and manifesto. It allows you to play in Dolphin with the Keyboard emulating the B0XX layout and outputs.

---

What's in:

-Override method

-ModX and ModY

-Firefox Angles

-Automatic  Shield Tilt (L)

-Manual Shield Tilt (R)

-Airdodge restrictions

-Full horizontal momentum for optimal ledgedash when both horizontals held

-Angled Fsmash with cstick & modX & U/D

-Dpad with both mods and cstick (original b0xx) and extra 4 buttons for single input dpad

-Side B Nerf

---

What's left (soonTM):

-Extended upB angles

-Smash DI Nerf

-Pivot Tilt Nerf

---

To install it:

1- Download and install vJoy here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/?source=typ_redirect

2- Run "Configure vJoy", set the number of buttons to 12, and hit apply.

3- Place the B0XX.ini file inside your dolphin-folder-name\User\Config\Profiles\GCPad folder.

4- In dolphin, open up controller config. Set player 1 to a standard controller, then hit configure. Under profile, select B0XX and hit load. Set device to vjoy. Then hit ok.

5- Run B0XX.exe. Make sure the Hotkeys.ini file is in the same dirrectory.

6- You can change your hotkeys by right clicking the small icon in the bottom right, and clicking Edit Controls.

Note: If some combinations are not working, you need a higher Rollover keyboard.

Feel free to ask me anything in the 20XX Discord. Also thanks to squible for making the first smashbox version which I edited to play like a B0XX.
